HELLO THERE!

To create a file for the function to read, you can use the included "UnTestfile.cpp" program to easily and quickly make it.
Else, you can use the following format (NOTE: The program ASSUMES you're in P3 format):

{
    
    P3

    # [Additional Notes, MUST BE ONE LINE]

    [Row] [Col]

    [B0] [B1] [B2]

    [B3] [B4] [B5]

    [B6] [B7] [Random Value]

    ...

}
note: One character contains 8 bits. To keep things even, every 9th RGB value is skipped.

HELLO THERE!

To create a file for the function to read, you can use the included "UnTestfile.cpp" program to easily and quickly make it.
Else, you can use the following format:

{
    P3
    # [Message, MUST BE ONE LINE]
    [Row] [Col]
    [B0] [B1] [B2]
    [B3] [B4] [B5]
    [B6] [B7] [Random Value]
    ...
}
note: One character contains 8 bits. To keep things even, every 9th RGB value is skipped.
